# Mark III Line Diagram

An Arduino Uno project making use of the [Vancouver SkyTrain Mark III line diagram](https://translinkstore.ca/collections/decor/products/mark-iii-in-car-line-diagram-evergreen), using WS2812 LEDs (also known as [NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168)).

This is just a fun stay-at-home COVID project, particularly for me to learn some electronics and working with an embedded system.
